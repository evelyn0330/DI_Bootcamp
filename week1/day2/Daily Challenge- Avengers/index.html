      <p id="about">
        Natalia Alianovna "Natasha" Romanoff (Russian: Наталья Алиановна
        "Наташа" Романова), also known as Black Widow, was one of the most
        talented spies and assassins in the entire world and a founding member
        of the Avengers. As a child, she was indoctrinated into the Red Room by
        General Dreykov, and briefly lived as the surrogate daughter of Alexei
        Shostakov and Melina Vostokoff while they were undercover in the United
        States of America. After the Destruction of the North Institute, she
        underwent extensive psychological conditioning, before graduating from
        the Red Room as a Widow. Working as an operative for the KGB, she was
        targeted by S.H.I.E.L.D., before given the chance to ultimately defect
        to the organization by Clint Barton by assassinating Dreykov. Romanoff
        succeeded, although having to use his daughter Antonia Dreykov's life as
        collateral damage would haunt her for the rest of her life.
